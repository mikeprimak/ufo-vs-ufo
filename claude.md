## Project Overview
N64 Mario Kart Battle Mode-style aerial combat game in Unity 2022.3 LTS (URP template).
- Low-poly UFO vehicles with arcade physics
- Small 3D arenas with vertical elements
- Third-person camera, wide FOV
- Simple projectile weapons and pickups
- AI opponents for single-player gameplay
- Must run on low-end PC (no dedicated GPU)

## Current Phase
**Phase 2 In Progress:** Combat mechanics and AI opponents

**Completed:**
- âœ… Basic UFO flight mechanics with keyboard and gamepad support
- âœ… Weapon system with pickups and firing
- âœ… Random weapon pickup boxes (mystery boxes)
- âœ… AI enemy implementation with state machine
- âœ… Laser weapon freezing bug fixed (OnDisable cleanup)
- âœ… UFO visual redesign: Unity primitive spheres (body + dome) instead of Blender model
- âœ… UFO color materials created (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) + dome glass material
- âœ… Game end screen with stats (kills, deaths, K/D, streaks, accuracy, MVP)
- âœ… Start screen with "Start Game" button
- âœ… Combat log UI (kill feed showing color-coded hits and kills)
- âœ… Canvas scaling fixed for all resolutions (1920x1080 reference)
- âœ… Death camera zoom out (40 units) for dramatic effect
- âœ… Death explosion system: 2-second timer triggers 60-unit blast radius with massive knockback
- âœ… UFO breakup effect: Dome and body gently separate at explosion moment
- âœ… Camera collision detection (prevents clipping through walls)
- âœ… Combat log weapon names: Shows weapon used in hit/kill messages
- âœ… Combat log deduplication: Only shows kill message, not both hit and kill
- âœ… Minimap system: Circular rotating overhead view with UFO blips
- âœ… Dash weapon: Speed boost + ramming damage + blue force field visual
- âœ… Start screen gamepad support (A button, Start, Space, Enter)
- âœ… Laser weapon: Blue color, 2x range (200 units)
- âœ… Weapon pickup animations: Enhanced spinning/bobbing, 5x scale
- âœ… Particle trail adjustments: Tighter positioning, better visibility
- âœ… Manual boost disabled (only combo boost from barrel rolls remains)
- âœ… Barrel roll buffer window: 0.4 seconds for easier chaining
- âœ… Aim indicator: 3D reticle shows where UFO weapons are currently aimed
- âœ… Vertical input ramping: Up/down aiming now has ease-in like left/right turning
- âœ… Increased max pitch: Steeper climbs/dives (ascending 100%, descending 80%)

## Next Session
**TODO:** Test and tune AI behavior
- AI opponents can patrol, seek weapons, chase, and attack
- Need to test 1v3 gameplay balance
- May need tuning of aggression, detection ranges, and attack behavior
- Consider adding difficulty settings or AI personality variations

## Key Scripts Overview

> **Full Inspector values in [claude-secondary.md](claude-secondary.md)**

### UFOController.cs - Flight & Movement
**Key Features:**
- Arcade physics with tight turns and responsive controls
- Banking/pitch visual effects (UFO_Visual child)
- **Turn ramping system**: Gradual ease-in for precise aiming
  - Starts at 0% sensitivity for fine adjustments
  - Ramps to 100% over ~0.3s when holding direction
  - Resets instantly on direction change or release
  - Controlled by `turnAcceleration` (default: 3)
- **Vertical ramping system**: Conditional ease-in for up/down aiming
  - **Only active when moving forward** (speed >= 0.1 units/sec)
  - When hovering/stationary: instant vertical control (no ramping)
  - When flying forward: slow ramp for precision target acquisition
  - Makes aiming much easier, prevents over-correction
  - Controlled by `verticalAcceleration` (default: 1.5 - half speed of turn ramp)
  - Forward threshold: `minForwardSpeedForRamping` (default: 0.1)
- **Velocity-based aim pitch**: Weapon aim calculated from actual velocity
  - Ascending: 100% of velocity angle (full pitch up)
  - Descending: 80% of velocity angle (slightly reduced pitch down)
- **Barrel roll dodge**: Directional evasion (Q/RB + stick direction)
  - No cooldown, can chain back-to-back
  - Buffer window: 0.4 seconds (was 0.2s - easier chaining)
  - Combo system: 3 rolls in 2s = 1.5x speed boost for 3s
- **Manual boost**: DISABLED (was LB to boost, now removed)
  - Only combo boost from barrel rolls remains
- Fast vertical movement (3x speed when moving only up/down)
- AI input support for enemy control

**Controls:**
- A/D or Buttons 0/1: Accelerate/Brake
- Arrows/Left Stick: Turn, Ascend/Descend
- Q/RB (Button 5): Barrel Roll (direction from stick)
- LB (Button 4): (UNMAPPED - manual boost removed)

### UFOCollision.cs - Bounce System
**Key Features:**
- **Wall bounces**: Physics reflection for natural deflection
- **Floor collisions**: Angle-based behavior
  - Steep descent: Dead stop or heavy bounce
  - Medium angle: Keep momentum, bounce up
  - Shallow scrape: Glide along floor
- Red flash on impact, brief stun on heavy crashes

### UFOHealth.cs - Health & Death
**Key Features:**
- **3 HP default**, 3-second invincibility frames after damage
- **Blink feedback** during i-frames (8 blinks/sec)
- **Death system**: Natural physics death with gentle tumble
  - Reduces velocity to 30% on death (no acrobatics)
  - UFO stays intact while falling (body + dome together)
  - Gentle random tumble (not crazy spinning)
  - High drag (2.0) and angular drag (3.0) for controlled fall
  - Becomes physics wreck, spawns small explosion, auto-cleanup
- **Death explosion (2 seconds after death)**:
  - Timer-based trigger (no collision detection needed)
  - 60-unit blast radius at UFO position (wherever it is)
  - Deals 1 HP damage to all UFOs in range
  - Applies massive knockback (80 force, vs 30 for regular explosions)
  - Properly attributes kills to original killer
  - Auto-scales explosion visual based on radius (3x missile size)
- **UFO breakup effect** (at explosion moment):
  - Dome detaches and becomes independent physics object
  - Gentle separation: dome drifts up slightly (0.5-1 unit) with small sideways drift (Â±0.5)
  - Body gets small opposite push so pieces drift apart slowly
  - High drag (2.0) prevents pieces flying off screen
  - Lazy tumbling on both pieces (not dramatic)
  - Both pieces cleaned up after wreck lifetime (10s)
- Prevents burst weapons from instant-killing

**Death Explosion Setup:**

## Scene Setup Notes

**Hierarchy:**
```
UFO_Player (Rigidbody + Sphere Collider + UFOColorIdentity)
â””â”€â”€ UFO_Visual (visual tilting container)
    â”œâ”€â”€ UFO_Body (Sphere primitive, flattened 3x1x3, team color material)
    â”œâ”€â”€ UFO_Dome (Sphere primitive, 1.2x1.2x1.2, glass material)
    â””â”€â”€ DirectionIndicator
```

**UFO Visual Design:**
- **Body**: Flattened sphere primitive (Scale: 3, 1, 3) with team color (Red/Blue/Green/Yellow)
- **Dome**: Sphere primitive (Scale: 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, Y-offset: 0.44) with UFO_Dome_Glass material
- **No colliders on children** - only parent has physics collider

**Physics Materials:**
- UFO_Bouncy: Friction 0, Bounce 0.5 (UFO + walls)
- Floor_Material: Friction 0, Bounce 0 (arena floor)

**Important:** UFO_Visual assigned to both UFOController and UFOCollision. Only parent has collider.

## Performance & Optimization

**Critical GPU Settings (Integrated GPU - NO dedicated GPU):**
- **MUST use URP-Performant** (NOT URP-HighFidelity)
- **NO real-time shadows** (check scene lights individually!)
- **NO HDR/MSAA** on camera
- **NO Depth/Opaque textures** in URP settings
- LaserWeapon: Low vertex counts (2), no shadows, no lighting data

**Common Issues:**
- Script changes don't apply â†’ Update Inspector values manually or re-add component
- UFO phases through walls â†’ Keep Bounce Force reasonable (10-50), check colliders
- D3D11 crash â†’ See [claude-secondary.md](claude-secondary.md) for full troubleshooting

## Development Roadmap

**Repository:** https://github.com/mikeprimak/ufo-vs-ufo

**Launch Plan:**
1. **Phase 2** (current): Combat mechanics + AI opponents
2. **Phase 3**: Polish single-player/local multiplayer
3. **Phase 4**: Release free on Steam/itch.io
4. **Phase 5**: Add online multiplayer ONLY if there's demand (Steam P2P or Photon free tier)

**Philosophy:** Fun first, complexity later. Focus on making core gameplay fun before adding networking infrastructure.
